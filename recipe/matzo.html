         Ingredients:
          <ul class = "Ingredients">
            <li> 1 4–5-lb. chicken, cut into 8 pieces  </li>
            <li> 1 pound chicken necks, and/or backs  </li>
            <li> 2 large yellow onions, unpeeled, quartered  </li>
            <li> 6 celery stalks, cut into 1 inch pieces  </li>
            <li> 4 large carrots, peeled, cut into 1 inch pieces  </li>
            <li> 3-4 sprigs flat-leaf parsley chopped fine </li>
            <li> 1 tbs dill weed </li>
            <li> Manichevitz matzo ball mix</li>

         Recipe:
          <ol class = "steps">
        <li> Bring all ingredients and 12 cups cold water to a boil in a very large (at least 12-qt.) stockpot. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until chicken breasts are cooked through, about 20 minutes </li>
        <li> Place dill weed and parsley in tea ball (brewing basket) and hang in the water while soup is cooking </li>
        <li> Transfer breasts to a plate (remaining chicken parts are strictly for stock). Let breasts cool slightly, then remove meat  </li>
        <li> Shred meat and set aside </li>
        <li> Continue to simmer stock, skimming surface occasionally, until reduced by one-third, about 2 hours. Strain chicken stock through a fine-mesh sieve (or a cheese cloth) into a large saucepan; discard solids with the exception of the carrots which should be returned to the stock. You should have about 8 cups </li>
        <li> Add the shredded chicken breasts back to the stock
        Prepare matzo mix according to package instructions </li>
        <li> Scoop out 2-tablespoonful portions matzo ball mixture and, using wet hands, gently roll into balls </li>
        <li> Add matzo balls to boiling broth and reduce heat so broth is at a gentle simmer (too much bouncing around will break them up). Cover pot and cook matzo balls until cooked through, 20–25 minutes </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
