        <p> This site is dedicated to tracking family recipies.  Over time and throughout different places, similar dishes evolve and become a families own dish.  I hope to be able to track that so all of the different recipies my wife and I know and love can be saved and passed on for years to come. </p>

        <p> As time goes on, I will continue to add and cook each of these, and will be updating the site along the way. </p>

        <p> If you have a reciple that you would like to add to this site, please feel free to email it to be using the link before.  </p>
